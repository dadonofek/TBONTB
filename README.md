TODO:
- rewrite the simulate_buying_scenario
- integrate mortgage calc
- evaluate params for cpi and "ogen" for Adjustable mortgage 
- validate mortgage_calc using the "משכנתאמן" calculator
- account for rent increase and income increase
- save data of sp 500 and dont download it every time
- save data of CPI from הלשכה המרכזית לסטטיסטיקה





thoughts:
- account for inflation in the final results?
- output some more complex probability measure
- move to web?
- more complex forecasting than GBM? we have no memory and only one random param
